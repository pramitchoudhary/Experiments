Changing It Up in the Bedroom$$$If youâre watching a channel called Discovery Fit & Health and someone starts talking about âthe lifestyle,â you might assume the reference is to a triathlon training regimen or a vegan diet. Not on a new show the channel offers on Saturday. The lifestyle in question involves spouse swapping and other alternatives to monogamy. The show, a four-part reality series, is called âSecret Sex Lives: Swingers,â and it looks at five couples who like to mix things up occasionally in the bedroom. And they could be that ordinary-looking couple next door.

âThe biggest misconception about the swinger lifestyle is that weâre hooking up with other people day and night, or that I used to be a stripper or something,â says Jaymee, who with her husband, Everett, does the swinging thing. Unlike Showtimeâs explicit âPolyamory,â about polyamorous relationships, this series, at least from the premiere, does not appear as if it is going to have bare skin and soft-core sex. But there is plenty of discussion of sex.

And there is a âFit & Healthâ component of sorts after all, at least to Jaymeeâs story in the opening episode. Everett is pressuring her to say yes to a threesome, but she has just had a baby and says she isnât yet confident enough in her âbody imageâ to resume their swinging ways.
