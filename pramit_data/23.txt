ROME — An Italian journalist and a Belgian teacher who were kidnapped in Syria in April have been freed, the Italian government said.

The government announced late Sunday night that Domenico Quirico, 62, a correspondent for the Turin newspaper La Stampa, would arrive soon on a flight to Rome.

Premier Enrico Letta’s office added in a statement that Belgian Pierre Piccinin was also “free” and was flying to Italy with Quirico.

Quirico had entered Syria from Lebanon on April 6 and disappeared three days later while traveling to the city of Homs in war-torn Syria.
