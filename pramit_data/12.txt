Rihannaâ€™s Rogue Fragrance Is Available Now!$$$Rihanna's fourth fragrance, Rogue, is hurr! After teasing us with two different print ads in July, we hadn't heard about the "flirty, sensual Oriental" scent in a while, but now we can spritz ourselves with it, carry it around with us, and moisturize with it. Yep, the scent comes in three different size bottles, plus a roller ball, and a body lotion. As if that wasn't enough, with any $69 purchase (that's one 4.2 oz bottle of the scent), you get a free clutch that matches the collection and has a brass-knuckle handle. Very tough. Very Rihanna.

Rihanna's perfume site also gives us some more deets on the scent and its campaign, though no sign (yet!) of the men's fragrance that Rih had once mentioned. The fragrance's tagline is "Push boundaries. Be bold. Go Rogue." which is def a motto Rihanna already lives by, big time. We are also given some info on the scent's notes, which includes lemon blossom, pink peppercorns, juicy plums, suede, sensual musk, and a lot more. Like, many more. With thirteen notes listed, it's Rih's most elaborate scent so far. Nude, for instance, has 10 notes. Steppin' up her scent game.

The set (plus the free clutch!) is available on Rih's perfume site, as well as at Macy's, Dillard's, and Belk. As for that men's scent, Rihanna promised it was coming soon, so we'll keep our eyes peeled for any info. And obviously, keep you updated.
