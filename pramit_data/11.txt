Ellen Page Wants To Make Joss Whedon's 'Kitty Pryde'$$$Joss Whedon has said in the past that he wants to make a Kitty Pryde movie some day. The current big-screen Kitty Pryde—next seen in 2014's "X-Men: Days of Future Past"—is all about that idea.

"I have heard that, yeah! Well, I'm available," actress Ellen Page said with a laugh in a new interview with Vulture. "I love that. Kitty Pryde's awesome. I'm super grateful to be the actress who's gotten to be her, and you only desperately hope that the true fans who have a right to demand what they want and who have been passionate about these stories for a really long time, that you can pull it off for them."

Page is feeling that exact pressure right now as she works on "X-Men: Days of Future Past," the series' latest sequel directed by Bryan Singer.

"I don't know how he pulls off everything he does in a day," she said of working with Singer, echoing similar high praise recently bestowed upon the director by Hugh Jackman. "He is really great with actors and really wants the truth of the performance to exist, to sort of elevate that kind of a film, which I feel he did with the first two 'X-Men' movies. He was sort of the first to take that kind of a spectacle of film and tell a deeply, deeply human story."

Depending on how the movie plays out, "Days of Future Past" might be the last "deeply human story" Page gets when it comes to Kitty Pryde. But she certainly hopes to continue the role.

"I would be so thrilled to play Kitty Pryde again," she said. "I really would."
