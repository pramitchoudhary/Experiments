'X-Men: Days Of Future Past': Jennifer Lawrence Opens Up About Mystique's Mutant Pride$$$A lot has changed for Jennifer Lawrence since she first covered herself in blue body paint for 2011's "X-Men: First Class." She's now an Oscar winner thanks to "Silver Linings Playbook," and she's a full-blown action hero thanks to the overwhelming success of "The Hunger Games." Following all that success, Lawrence returned to the role of the shape-shifting mutant known as Mystique for next year's "X-Men: Days of Future Past." But it turns out that her mutant alter-ego has done a bit of changing over the past few years as well.

"I'm naked," said Lawrence in an interview with SciFiNow. "But when I do get to wear clothes, I love the '70s outfits."

The sequel has jumped forward a decade in time to the groovy '70s, and the effects have already been seen on the likes of Professor X; check out James McAvoy in these retro threads. Mystique's look isn't totally naked all the time, though, as the actress previously revealed to E! News that she'd also be sporting a blue bodysuit in the film.

But clothes aren't the only thing different this time around, reveals Lawrence. "She's different in this film too," said Lawrence. "She was struggling—like a lot of normal humans—with the way she looked, and she was covered up a lot in the first movie, but this time she is Mutant and proud."

The film will pick up a decade after Mystique left Charles Xavier's side to join Magneto's mutant revolution, so we'll also find out just how kindly this partnership has treated her. "X-Men: Days of Future Past" opens on May 23rd, 2014
