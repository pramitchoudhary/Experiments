Watch the "Worst Twerk Fail EVER -- Girl Catches Fire!" video after the jump.

1.) DON'T TWERK ON A DOOR: You must be able to rely on the stability of your twerking surface. Same goes for windows and lazy Susans.

2.) DON'T TWERK NEAR AN OPEN FLAME: The only "fi-yah" should be what's on the dance floor.

3.) COORDINATE TWERK TIME: If possible, try to schedule twerking with family, roommates, or anyone else you cohabitate with. Also, it doesn't hurt to have a spotter just in case you -- oh, I don't know -- fall backwards onto a glass coffee table and catch fire.

4.) DON'T YELL AT FIRE: Use water to put out a flame, not your words. We really shouldn't have to go over this.
